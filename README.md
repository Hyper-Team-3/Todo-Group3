Hi! Welcome to our group project - to do list!

If you want to have a look, here's the link https://todo-group3-client.vercel.app/

This project was done in 3 weeks by 5 people, to practice backend concepts such as database setup, user authentication and authorization, and REST api and HTTP protocol.

The client side is made with React, and the server side is made with Node.JS, Express, postgreSQL and pg. 

To practice further, ci/cd was included and swagger ui was used to document the api.

While building this project, we learned a lot of important concepts such as how to set up the database, how to connect, how to securely handle the password with hashing, and how to put, post, delete the data while following the HTTP protocol. 

We also did not forget to keep the best practices of frontend such as responsive design, and to creat context instead of drilling the props. 

The deployment was done with Vercel for both frontend and backend. 

Thank you for visiting!
